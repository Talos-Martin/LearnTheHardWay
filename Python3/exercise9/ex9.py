thats actually curious
what'll happen now?
Let's see

        "us"

        )   #3 doubles quotes around 'a' didnt work, as expected
#interesting that it keeps the identation

#print(""""why not 4 quotes?"""")
#not 4 because that doesnt work
#double quotes just starts and ends an empty string, so no dice either
